# Insoluble Concrete

Stops concrete powder from hardening when touching water

Instead, throw the concrete powder items into a water cauldron!

This means your concrete only hardens when you want it to! useful for when you want to build under or around water!

*The mod is required on the server*, but having it on the client is not necessary - without it the concrete will harden for a second client-side before the client receives the actual block update from the server
